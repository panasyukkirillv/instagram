        <p>
          Like most website operators, Topgrowth.one collects
          non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
          and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
          language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
          visitor request. Topgrowth.one purpose in collecting non-personally
          identifying information is to better understand how Topgrowth.one
          visitors use its website. From time to time, Topgrowth.one may release
          non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
          publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        </p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

        <p>
          Certain visitors to Topgrowth.one websites choose to interact with
          Topgrowth.one in ways that require Topgrowth.one to gather
          personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
          that Topgrowth.one gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
          For example, we ask visitors who purchase and track the order
          information at topgrowth.one to provide a username and email.
